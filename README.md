Pig - Dice Game

The Basics of Pig-Dice
Players
Best with 2, can work with more. (The downtime between your turns grows longer with each additional player.)
Equipments
1 six-sided die, score sheet, pen or pencil.
Goal
Be the first player to reach 100 points.
GamePlay

  On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly until either:

    A 1 is rolled
    The player chooses to hold (stop rolling)

  If a 1 is rolled, that player's turn ends and no points are earned.

If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.
Game End
When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
